## 1.4 Navigate a Competition
First familiarize yourselves with the competition details by viewing the `Get Started`-Pane
<img width="590" height="411" alt="Pasted image 20260420094102" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7be6855c-2efd-4f7d-a0c6-bd3806dc2901" />

## 1.4.1 Competition Resources
A competition usually contains public and private resources. Example resources may be
- the scoring functions used to score submissions
- a starter kit, providing detailed instructions and exemplary submissions
- training- and validation data
- ...

Publicly available assets are downloadable via the `files`-page in the `Get Started`-Pane
<img width="590" height="411" alt="Pasted image 20260420095223" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f4ba9fcd-385e-422b-9519-777a35c2784f" />

## 1.4.2 Phases
A competition may be structured in multiple sequential phases. You can find individual phase-details via the `Phases`-Pane
<img width="590" height="411" alt="Pasted image 20260420095554" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/657bfa79-86fa-4827-95b1-ba6ecea26743" />

## 1.4.3 Submissions
In the `My Submissions`-Pane you can submit a new submission and/or view past submissions. Additionally, you can choose the submissions to be considered in the leaderboard and whether you want to submit as an organization.
<img width="670" height="605" alt="Pasted image 20260420095912" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0f55a68c-a6e4-4c65-9002-9e1f01fe765a" />

If a competition consists of multiple phase choose the according phase. Additionally, a phase may consist of multiple tasks to be chosen from during submission, depending on the task the submission contributes to.
>[!Note]
>You can find more details on the submission within 2.X and 3.X respectively.
## 1.4.4 Leaderboards
For each potential phase, there exists a leaderboard pivoted by the tasks per phase. The leaderboards can be viewed in the `Results`-Pane
<img width="590" height="411" alt="Pasted image 20260420100609" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eac9db4c-3c67-41aa-9ee6-6077395b3f65" />

>[!Warning]
>Leaderboards within the **MunitQuest**-Challenges are at any point provisionary.
>The official, result-relevant leaderboards will be published after the respective phases/challenges have finished

## 2.1 Submission Format
codabench requires submission to be a zip-Archive. The zip-Archive should have the following structure for the automated validator to run.
```
root/
└── BIDSDataset  -> name of the dataset
    ├── dataset_description.json
    ├── participants.tsv
    ├── participants.json
    ├── README
    ├── sub-01/
    │   ├── emg/
    │   │   ├── sub-01_task-xxx_emg.edf

    │   │   ├── sub-01_task-xxx_electrodes.tsv
    │   │   └── sub-01_task-xxx_coordsystem.json
    │   └── ...
    └── sub-02/
        └── ...
```

>[!Warning]
>To save storage, please do not upload the actual EMG-recordings, but only the metadata.
>After successful metadata validation, we will provide a link to the cloud storage, where to
>upload the full dataset

## 2.2 How to Submit
1. In the codabech-competition navigate to `My Submissions` (see 1.4.3)
2. Choose whether to submit as yourself or as a registered team (see 1.2)
3. Upload the zip-Archive
4. Wait for preliminary, automated dataset validation results

>[!Tip]
>The integrated stdout/stderr terminal window may be incomplete. To see the full stdout/stderr of your submission, you can view to the logs displayed in detail, when clicking on your submission and navigating to the `LOGS`-Tab.

5. Download submission artifacts (especially `detailed_results.html`) by navigating to your submission and downloading `Output from scoring step`
6. Investigate `detailed_results.html`, which contains an upload link, if and only if the metadata validation has been successful
7. Choose whether the submission should appear on the competition's leaderboard, by pressing the `table`-icon in the submissions overview

>[!Warning]
>We highly encourage you to upload different datasets and, thus, enable multiple leaderboard-effective submissions. If you, however, wish to update an already submitted dataset on the leaderboard, make sure to remove the old version from the leaderboard. Please notify the organizers when submitting multiple datasets!
